### Principal Component Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook focusing on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction in machine learning. PCA is a widely used technique for reducing the number of features in a dataset while preserving the most important information. This notebook provides an in-depth exploration of PCA, its applications, advantages, and implementation using Python's scikit-learn library.

#### Overview:
Dimensionality reduction is essential in machine learning to address issues related to large datasets, computational complexity, and feature redundancy. PCA is a powerful technique used to transform high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while retaining as much variance as possible. By reducing the number of features, PCA simplifies data representation, visualization, and computational requirements.

#### Contents:
1. **Introduction to Dimensionality Reduction**: Explanation of dimensionality and the need for reducing feature space.
2. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Detailed discussion on PCA, its objectives, and steps involved.
